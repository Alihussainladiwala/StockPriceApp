# Steps to run the project:
- type `npm start` on the terminal to run the frontend
- type `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001` on the terminal to run the backend.

# Backend
- The data is fetched from a mock backend [db.json](https://github.com/Alihussainladiwala/StockPriceApp/blob/main/stock-price/db.json). Add addtional rows by modifying the same.

## Hightlights:
- Each component within the project has its own documentation
- I have used vanilla CSS throughout the project and have not used any framework.
- The various components in this project are completely reusable
- List of components:
