# Steps to run the project:
- type `npm start` on the terminal to run the frontend
- type `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001` to run the backend.

# Backend
- The data is fetched from a mock backend db.json. Add addtional rows by modifying the same.

## Hightlights:
- Each component within the project has its own documentation
- I have used vanilla CSS throughout the project and have not used any framework.
- The various components in this project are completely reusable
- List of components:
	+ Card
	+ Grid
	+ NavBar
	+ Filter
